# BookLibrary

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.8.

## Instructions
- `git clone` this repository or download it as a `Zip` file
- On the root folder, run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Run `ng serve` to start a dev server.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. You should be able to see the application
- If you want to interact with the application, you must also be running the docker image wich cointains the [Backend and the Database of the project ](https://github.com/Jhonier-Jimenez/flask-rest-api). If not, follow the instructions there.
- After everything is set up, you will be able to Get, Add, Update, and Delete all books

## Further development
- Since the backend is already providing all CRUD operations for Authors too, we should add the implementation for them in the frontend.
